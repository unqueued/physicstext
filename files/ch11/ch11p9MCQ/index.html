 motion is defined as the propagation of the disturbance due to 
continuous vibration of the molecules of the medium. When the transverse
 wave is propagating through the cord, the piece of the cord is 
vibrating and executes simple harmonic motion. The speed of the particle
 is continuously varying but wave is moving with constant speed through 
the cord. So, the option is (a) is not correct. </p>  <p>The particle is
 completing one oscillation as one wave is passing out. So, the number 
of oscillations made by the particle in one second is equal to the 
number of wave passing through the same point in one second. Hence the 
frequency of wave is equal to the frequency of the piece of the cord. 
So, the option (b) is correct.</p>  <p>The maximum displacement of the 
particle from its mean position is called amplitude which is called as 
amplitude of the wave. So, the option (c) is also correct. Hence both 
options (b) and (c) are true.</p>  <p>Therefore, the correct options is<img src="ch11p9MCQ-files_simplified/11449-11-9MCQ-i1.png">.</p></div></div></div></section></li></ol><!-- react-text: 326 --><!-- /react-text --></section></section>		<!-- End content -->
